#### Status:

I've developed this prototype using Chrome. It's currently not really playable on Firefox. ðŸ˜¢


## How to play:

* Avoid the obstacles by pressing the `space bar` on your keyboard to make Flappy Bird go up.

* Press `q` to quit at any time.

* Press `r` to restart after you've hit an obstacle or touched the bottom of the screen;
